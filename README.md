 Inferential Statistics Ib - Frequentism Learning objectives Welcome to the second Frequentist inference mini-project! Over the course of working on this mini-project and the previous frequentist mini-project, you'll learn the fundamental concepts associated with frequentist inference. The following list includes the topics you will become familiar with as you work through these two mini-projects:  the z-statistic the t-statistic the difference and relationship between the two the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values how those confidence intervals and p-values allow you to perform hypothesis (or A/B) tests Prerequisites what a random variable is what a probability density function (pdf) is what the cumulative density function is a high-level sense of what the Normal distribution
